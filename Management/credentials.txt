Hi Erty,

We have created the game server on our hosted server.
I have her a login for you so you can stop/start, upload/download and so on.

Right now, we cant give you access to the db file, because it is in the root folder.
So we might need a way to change the location of the db in a future release, so you can get access to it, if needed.
