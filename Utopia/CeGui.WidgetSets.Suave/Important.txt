The "Suave" theme is based on a Windows XP theme created by Mohsin Naqi.

Graphics were taken unmodified from that theme and put together to
create the CeGui "Suave Look" by Markus Ewald (aka "Cygon" on SourceForge).

The original artist has agreed to allow for unlimited usage of this theme as long
as he is credited for his art. So if you decide to publish a project that uses
the theme, please give due credit to the original artist!
